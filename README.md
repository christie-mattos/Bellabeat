# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project: Bellabeat

## Summary of the Project:

For my Google Data Analytics capstone project, I chose to analyze the data for a fictional organization called Bellabeat, which produces smart fitness devices. My objective with this project is to analyze Bellabeat's smart usage data in order to gain insight into how people are using their smart devices, and make marketing recommendations based on the data. The request was very open ended so there were many ways it could have been analyzed.

## My solution to the request:

I used the data to compare the exercise practices of Bellabeat users to nonusers and found that based on the data provided by Bellabeat and compared to non-users, Bellabeat users tended to exercise more than nonusers and that Bellabeat users are 29% more likely to be meeting exercise goals to combat heart disease (per CDC guidelines) than nonusers. Heart disease is the #1 killer of women, so there is a large amount of incentive for all women to try to combat this disease. My marketing recommendation to Bellabeat was to offer Bellabeat products as statistically proven tools to help combat heart disease.

## Dataset:

This dataset is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit).
